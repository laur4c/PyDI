PYDI: A simple but effective DI and AOP framework for python
================================================================================

PYDI is a framework that provides you with DI and AOP in your own
projects. If you're
familiar with the Spring framework (either for Java or .NET), then
you'll have no trouble using PYDI. 
Just create your beans xml file and you're ready to go (see below).

NOTICE: This is an experimental framework (I'm writing it to get a feel for the
language in question). I will be adding more cool features to pydi (like aop
support via decorators) and improve it. Be patience,
pydi is one of my first steps in python... any comments are welcome! ;-)

I read about aop in python, and i saw that python already support this
concept by using decorators.
In fact i use them, but i think that using this framework can be
helpful in keeping your code clear. 
you only need to configure a xml file and go code your aspects. ;-)


Note: you can see full examples about how to use the framework in the
examples directory.
